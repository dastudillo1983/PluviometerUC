# PluviometerUC

In this project we work on a pluviometer datalogger. The schematics are developed in Altium and code of the pluviometer is developed in micropython. The code will upload when the paper "Design and implementation of a datalogger system for recording rainfall intensity data based on the LoPy4 development card" is accepted.
